# Leaflet-Challenge

This challenge uses the D3 skills taught in class to pull data and reproduce on an interactive map. Data from USGS "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson" which shows the past 7 days worth of earthquakes recorded are added to a map using the leaflet and openmap tile functions. We use d3.json to pull the data and then reproduce the portions we need to show intensity, depth and location on a map. We start this from the index.html file where I give a brief descritpion of the map and what you should expect. The page has a hyperlink that allows you to access the required map. 
Thank you
