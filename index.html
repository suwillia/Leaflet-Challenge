            <p align= "left" style="font-size: 30px;">This page retrieves data from the USGS earthquake website and displays visualizations of earthquakes from the past seven days. The earthquake magnitudes are represented by circle sizes, with larger circles indicating higher magnitudes. Additionally, the depth of each earthquake is shown on a color scale ranging from green (closer to the surface) to red (deeper). By clicking on a marker you will be able to see the location, magnitude, depth and time of occurence.Please click on the link to access the visualizations. </p>
